- 👋 Hi, I’m @seemetv
- 👀 I’m interested in how to build highly responsive iPhone and Android apps 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use VSCode, React Native, and Tailwind CSS 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on errors that I recieve. As a new coder, this language is very unfamiliar to me. 
- I have tried to immerse myself into learning what different code errors me. I always try to use my
- resources available to me like Google, Reddit, YT, and GitHub. I typically only ask questions when I 
- have exhausted all avenues, and I am still stumped. 
- 📫 How to reach me I can be emailed at seemetv21@gmail.com
